# ColonySelector
ColonySelector is a semi-automated colony counter that allows you to predict colonies and also fix the clustering by hand.

Set up the enviroment for the Gui with the following comand line:

            conda env create -f path/to/enviroment.yml 

This will create a conda enviroment with the nesesary packages to run the Gui. Information on how to run these scripts can be found in the wiki [here](https://github.com/raanreye/ColonySelector/wiki)
